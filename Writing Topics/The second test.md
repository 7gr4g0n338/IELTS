First, `We started a team with 9 members and then up to 40 member with 20 subjects which we teached` WE STARTED WITH A TEAM OF 9 MEMBERS, WHICH GREW TO 40 MEMBERS COVERING 20 SUBJECTS THAT WE TAUGHT. Additionally, We helped many students `get` ACHIEVE A or B+ grades when the exam season was coming. `So i'm very happy and proud of my friends when they show their grade table. And then We decided to record teaching videos and upload them to the website to reduce time for students and spend time to explain every student's questions.
