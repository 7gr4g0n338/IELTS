## Describe a hobby that you do with friends or family.

Why you enjoy doing it with them?<br/>

To be honest, I think I have a wide range of interests such as watching movie, driving bicycle, reading book, listening music ... and reading book is one of my favourite ways to escape from the daily grind. <br/>

I often read book in my room and share experience which I learnt with my friends. I usually read books at the crack of dawn or the night when I free time. During this time, I only focus on reading and turn off all electric devices, I think I'm swimming in the book pages at that moment. <br/>

the first reason I love reading book is that it is very interesting to discovery new things in books. Books make me open the mindset about how way everything active. moreover, I can apply all things i read to my life and see happened results. For example, I tried to apply a lesson about "How to understand a girl" to help my girl friend when she sad and I realized that a girl is a problem. So it's mission impossible. It's a great way to connect to friends by sharing your experience and finding common opinions. Finnaly, reading book make man become a gentleman.
